### How to organize the comma separated words to new line using Visual Studio Code?
- Select the first comma and then Press `CTRL+D` for few times until multi cursor appears after all the commas.
- Once the multi cursor appears after every comma (i.e after every word)  then press `Enter`.
- Press `Esc` to come out of the Multi Cursor Mode.
- Select the Keys `CTRL + ALT + 🠋` which will place the vertical cursor to the lines needed and then we can press `Backspace` to correct the indentation.
